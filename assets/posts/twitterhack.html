        <h1>What the Twitter Hack Means to you</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="box-container">
        <p>
            Midway into august and the infamous Twitter hack of 
            July 2020 is wrapping up. The mastermind behind it 
            all the seventeen-year-old from Florida. Being new
             to the scene of writing, I will honor the old ways,
              and not mention the kids name. It seems now the
               United States plans to make an example out of him.
                This young man amassed 30 felonies, who said the 
                younger generation doesn’t have ambitions?
    All jokes aside, there was an actual cost to this. 100,000
     dollars may not seem like much, but it is more the principal
      that number holds. The only reason the whole attack was not 
      completely successful comes down to one team doing something
       right. No, it isn’t Twitter, it’s the team at Coinbase. 
       Anyone who doesn’t know this is a Bitcoin exchange company. 
       They have proper rules and procedures in  place to catch
        suspicious and fraudulent activity. Not only that if it 
        wasn’t for the fact getting an account requires you to 
        provide a drivers license as identification, the kid would
         have never been caught. Good job Coinbase!<br><br> There are plenty of articles that walk through the hack, speculate on past crimes, and name the accomplices. However here, we will take a different look at this, one from that sweet C level position.
    As CFO and CEO the bottom line is always the bottom dollar.
     Afterall, you don’t get to that level without earning a buck 
     or two. That is one of the reasons when you see a request for
      funding, or even an request for attendance to a security 
      awareness drill, you roll you eyes. However, as a C level 
      executive, you aren’t immune to these unsophisticated social
       engineering and phishing attacks. That is why we call it 
       spear phishing after all.  So, before you roll your eyes 
       or hit the golf field the next security exercise that comes 
       around, attend it. Keeping the end user sharp and aware of 
       threats is the only way to help mitigate these attacks like 
       Twitter faced in July.<br><br><br>
	What can developers and security teams take away from this Even in the face of big change such as the remote workforce transition, doesn't mean give up security. We know we shouldn't write passwords on sticky notes, why pin them on a social media avenue? Take away number two, as a whole we are relying on so many others’ code and applications. Whether communication, connection, source control, or a key piece  of the CI/CD pipeline our security often lies in some other companies' hand. Why wait until they are breached? We can be mindful of the possibility now.
	As for security teams, I have a somewhat lucrative idea. We spend all this money as an organization for test, reports and engagements. If our office has migrated to our home, why is that network not considered the corporate network? Because it is your home, your bandwidth? No, I disagree, I believe at a time like this it is indeed apart of the corporate network. These home networks should be held to all the same scrutiny as any other outward facing appliance or application. Only then, can we gain a security maturity to stay at least half a step ahead of the bad guys.
