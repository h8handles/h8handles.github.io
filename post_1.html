         <h1>Loving the Work Vs Loving the Job </h1>
     </div>
     <div class="posts">
         <p>At about half way through my first year in my degree, I have noticed something. The motivation behind a lot of my peers seems to be the job instead of the work. Now I know that can sound pretty obfuscated, but allow me to explain. 
            <br>
            <br>
            First I would have to start with the why. Why did I decide to pursue a degree in cybersecurity. Well, while going through a hard time in my life, I jumped from hobby to hobby. Growing up I always loved computers but never considered myself “smart enough.” One day, watching a video on Youtube after a long rabbit hole of “related videos” I discovered a hacking video. Now, I had dabbled in coding and scripting before then, and something just called out to me. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I went on a six month bender of cramming as much knowledge as I could unearth. Video after video, write up after write up. I tried to practice everyday no matter what until one day, I decided enough is enough. I wanted to make something of my life and this seemed like a plausible route. Before you know it, I am taking a placement test.<br>
            Now, this brings me to the point of this post. By no means do I intend to talk down on my peers if ever they happen to stumble across this. Maybe, hopefully, I can shed some light or at least spark a new idea or desire. I applied to this field because I found joy in the little things that make the field up. I desire to know as much as I can, which in this industry is hard. It is rapidly changing and you have to have the passion and desire to stay on-top of trends in the industry.<br><br>
            <br>I think I have a potential solution to interesting students to improve and learn in a gamified manor. The days where Cyber or Networking weren't a major or field of study have long passed. Now, we must push the new brains of the world to challenge fight and break things, not for malicious intent but instead to learn how something works to better show how to improve the software or device. We need inovative minds in education to create and tweak the course material to fit the path of todays cyber initiative.
