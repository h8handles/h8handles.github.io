            The issues and risks of these IOT “smart” devices filling every room of the average American have
            become a huge risk. Earlier this year we heard about voice recordings being triggered by lasers,
             light bulbs having the ability to record us, and now remote installation of skills in the Amazon
              Alexa systems. This article from The Hacker News (Linked at the bottom) outlines the work done by Checkpoint 
              Security. Time and time again they come to us with game changing research. This leads me to a 
              thought, besides money, why do American companies continue to pump out device after device without
               proper testing. When it comes to the automotive, or pharmaceutical business, they go through rigorous 
               testing and quality assurance before going to market. Why can’t tech companies, seeing daily the number
                of flaws and vulnerabilities released on a weekly basis, act the same way?<br><br> If you want to sit here
                 and argue dollar signs with me, lets be realistic. The average cost of cyber attacks 
            to the average organization is roughly 1.4 million dollars. Do you think that some user education yearly or quarterly 
            even would come close to that? I am willing to bet not, but yet somehow still security isn’t at the forefront of most
             organizations. This brings me to my first point, why do we allow developers to come in and build a piece of our system, without security certifications and knowledge? We have security teams to manage and run the day to day yes, and that will never change. But what would happen if we started to hold our developers to a higher standard? Would security not inherently change? 
            Now, lets talk about the subject at hand, IOT (Internet of things). These are devices, that as first put by Microsoft
             after unveiling the concept some years ago, as devices to connect our world. These are electronics with more spying 
             capabilities than a KGB agent, yet we willingly put them in every room. We as a society are just now starting to
              realize the impact of surveillance capitalism on our privacy, freedom, and free thought. As this comes further into 
              the light, I would like for us to start to question a little more. We need more people to write to their representatives, 
              to their leaders, and ask them to hold these giants of tech more responsible for the collection of the data they possess.
               Look at the UK and California, what a step in the direction that we need to head. Yet, we could go further. I am no lawyer 
               or politician, but I believe no matter what side of the fence, your data is important.
            If it isn’t your data what else could you possibly worry about? It is probably safe to say by now you have heard of the problems 
            the Ring doorbell had recently. With that in mind, lets think about all the new devices we see advertised to us, how we say to our
             self “oh I really need that.” Why? When what we have before still works and is improving. Americans seem so quick to want the next
              and best thing, without the thought of security. As consumers, security needs to start to take a leading role in our technology
               purchases.
